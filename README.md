no-frills.js
=========
A minimalistic SPA (Single Page Application) framework without any bloat. This framework is suitable for JavaScript developers who are looking for a base for their applications or to explore and extend the possibilities of this framework.

The framework was created after i asked the question: "How hard can it be to make a Single Page Application framework without so many dependencies", and this is the result!

*Please note: This is an active project, there are still many ways to improve it but most importantly, this was created as a technical exercise.*

## Features
* lightweight
* router
* controller (per route)
* template engine with Mustache integrated
