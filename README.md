============
A minimalistic SPA (Single Page Application) framework without any bloat. This framework is suitable for JavaScript developers who are looking for a base for their applications or to explore and extend the possibilities of this framework.

The framework was created after i asked the question: "How hard can it be to make a Single Page Application framework without so many dependencies", and this is the result!

*Please note: This is an active project, there are still many ways to improve it but most importantly, this was created as a technical exercise.*

## Features
* Lightweight (6.7kB minified, 2.8kB minified & gzipped)
* Router
* Controller (per route)
* Template Engine with Mustache integrated

## Current Version
The current version is 0.1.0, which is suited for development and pre-production use.
